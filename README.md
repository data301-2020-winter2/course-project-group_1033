## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{Our group is interested in investigating the many different interesting features located on planets and smaller planetary bodies across the solar system. With this topic of choice, we hope to have a better understanding of the many types, size, and locations of unique planetary features that exist around us. Some of these features include different craters, satellite features, and mountain ranges (Mons). There is a lot of important nomenclature to learn from Latin and Greek names that identify specific features. What makes this topic of choice even more interesting is that will be able to transform our data into something that can be easily readable for average users. Sometimes space names and complex numerical notation can be unappealing for average people. In this project we hope to transform this data set to make it more appealing to others, so it can serve as a tool for people to have a better understanding of our solar system.   }
